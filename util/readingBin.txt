for reading binary, we need to do (or have the following)

1) array of size of each of the data figures (will need struct if different types, or we can ignore the naming labels)
2) for fread, the size of the stride is the size of the data figures, (if they are bytes, use unsigned char and print out with %u)
3) if we need to conver data types, use two separate arrays. use ato[datatype] for chars, and just use casting ([datatype]) var for unsigned char
